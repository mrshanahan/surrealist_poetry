Words separated by parts of speech in poetry_wordlist; parts indicated by
tags parsed in script.  Running with no arguments produces a single four-line
poem in a default format:
$ python poetry.py

Infernal bomb demolishes by a confounded balloon?
The exquisite lettuce slaps as a smeared stream;
Magnanimous quicksand balloos restlessly; utterance:
The fascist stranger commends through the wayward kitten.

$

One can provide a custom format as the first argument (this will be updated soon):

$ python poetry.py RANVPRAN

A malicious coast cessates for the rapt damnation.

$

I'll try to add in a multiplayer mode ASAP; for now, this will just generate
random poems.
